            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. WHen through the fire of Repentance we get into the Spirit of <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin, the Bride in our Souls, and are falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts feet the Bridegroom, we

taſte of the Love that through Faith God preſents us with, which we find experimentally true when ever we make tryal of the ſame; yet the Bridegroom will never admit of any to come to ſuch a communion with him, but the Bride only, who cometh through fire to drink of the living Waters, into the inward ſociety of Love; for then there is no more a comprehenſion, but a divine commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and union through faith. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16, 17. <hi>And we have known and beleeved the love that God hath to us: God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of Judgment, becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this world.</hi> And thus we find the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166934:3"/>
ſaying true, <hi>My yoke is eaſie and my burthen is light;</hi> whereby we are made likewiſe to live one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the unity of love and the bond of peace, as well as within our ſelves, finding the beaſts of the field, who lived before in enmity, living now in <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark in perfect amity, in our hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. O take heed of ſtifling in your ſouls the light which leads you to the diſcovery of your ſelves. Look but in your conſciences, and 'twill enlighten every corner and crany thereof; but doubt not, neither fear to look upon thoſe Images it will infallibly manifeſt to your ſoul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Herein is all the policy the Devil hath, to keep you from looking inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly and candidly into your

ſelves; Knowing he hath no other way but to blind you therein, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to continue you under his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: for if once you do diſcern the hideous Monſters and Sorcerers he doth delude you with as natural men, you will never take more pleaſure in them; but his art is to diſguiſe them, and make them ſeem otherwiſe then they are; and he is terribly afraid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all meaſure you ſhould know you have the Word in your Souls, leſt it ſhould come into your hearts. <hi>John</hi> 1.4.5. <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light ſhined in darkneſs, and the darkneſs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it not.</hi>

nature and humanity, onely to ſuffer, and make peace through the Blood of his Croſs, but to tell us alſo that he is the light and life in our Conſciences. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 26, 27, 28. <hi>Even the Myſtery which hath been hid from ages, and from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, but now is made manifeſt to his Saints, To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this Myſtery among the Gentiles, which is Chriſt in you, the hope of Glory: Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wiſdom, that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Man is fallen into death; he hath awakened the ſpirit of all creatures in him, of a Fox, a Lion, a Goat, a Swine, &amp;c. Here is the death we are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166934:5"/>
fallen into, and to theſe we muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely dye in this life-time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as little children again; then ſhall we ſee the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> written in our hearts, and find the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world: and if upon the diſcovery of this divine light, ye repent; then ſhall you fulfil in your ſelves the great Myſtery, and through the mighty power of faith, witneſs Chriſt riſen a quickening Spirit in your hearts: Then you ſhall evidence it is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; there is a natural body, and there is a ſpiritual body: and ſo it is written, <hi>The firſt man Adam was made a living Soul, the laſt man Adam a quickening Spirit.</hi> Now if we look into our ſelves through the power of God, we
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:166934:5"/>
ſhall ſee our ſelves, that we were a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul, free from the ſubjection of the ſpirits of the beaſts of the world; and if through the virtue and merit of Chriſt, we co-operate with him ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, we ſhall find our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a quickened ſpirit, dead unto theſe natural, corruptible deſires. And thus ſhall we eaſily beleeve the Son of God was ſlain himſelf in our huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by the <hi>Jews,</hi> if we do but reflect on our ſelves, and find that we ſlay him in our hearts dayly as ſinners, unleſs we Regenerate our ſouls; then are our ſacrifices no more the ſacrifices of <hi>Cain,</hi> but of <hi>Abel:</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 8. <hi>Whoſoever abideth in him, ſinneth not: Whoſoever ſinneth, hath not ſeen him, neither known him.</hi>

               <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the Devil, for the Devil ſinneth from the beginning: for this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſt, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> And our freedom is in Righteouſneſs. <hi>But Jeruſalem which is above is free, which is the Mother of us all, Gal.</hi> 4.26. <hi>But as then he that was born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit, even ſo it is now.</hi> Read likewiſe the duty of the children of the Spirit, Chap. 5. v. 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance: againſt ſuch there is no Law. And they that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts. If we live in the Spirit,

            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Prepare therefore for him, and go out of darkneſs, which hinders you from ſeeing him, leſt he come like a Thief in the night, whileſt you live in your unbelief, worſhipping of Images in your own wiſdom and imagination only, denying the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, which is continually ſo neer you. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.17.28. <hi>That they ſhould ſeek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us. For in him we live, and move, and have our being, as certain alſo of your own Poets have ſaid, For we are alſo his off-ſpring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. O prevent theſe things; leſt Chriſt, the Sun of Righteouſneſs, when your Soul after death ſhall riſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:166934:7"/>
out of your worldly will and fancy, committing Idolatry with your own wiſdoms, and excluding the wiſdom of God; he will then make all things manifeſt and apparent at his coming, ſhewing you your miſerie, by the Holy Ghoſt the Spirit of Truth, at which time your ſoul will loſe the harmonie and virtue of the light of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. One <hi>Adam</hi> was created a living ſoul, and another muſt become a quickning Spirit; now the Virgin-fire that is in every mans ſoul, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all its wiſdom and its ſelfiſhneſs, which it hath got by falling from the Will of God, and Regenerate the ſame: The mortification of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is onely in order to that work; here nothing but the Virgin-fire of

faith can prevail, the wiſdom of man is fooliſhneſs before God. This is the ſingle Talent that is given to every man; but if he bury the ſame in the ground, it is given to him that hath ten Talents; tis the light in every mans conſcience, which according to its proportion would augment it ſelf; but the ſlothful ſervant ſaith this is very difficult to do, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the body, and Regenerate the ſoul entirely likewiſe. Who can do this? can this ever be done in this life? ſure I am it muſt be done before we can poſſeſs Heaven, no impure and undefiled thing can enter there: then if a man may do it when he dies, why not an hour before? if an hour before, why not an year before? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is true, the <hi>Cherubins</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doth righteouſneſs is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, even as he is righteous. He that committeth ſin is of the Devil, for the Devil ſinneth from the beginning: for this purpoſe the Son of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil. Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin: for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin becauſe he is born of God.</hi> And chap. 5.18. <hi>We know that whoſoever is born of God ſineth not: but he that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of God keepeth himſelf, and

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:166934:10"/>
is divine reaſon whereby Chriſt is known in the ſpirit, in the new-birth; for by the wiſdom of man we cannot comprehend him, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, he is only known in the ſpirit by his power and vertue, where he revealeth himſelf. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.21. <hi>In that hour Jeſus rejoyced in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſaid, J thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes: even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. <hi>For Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel: not with wiſdom of words, leſt the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect. For the preaching of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:166934:10"/>
the Croſs is to them that periſh, fooliſhneſs: but unto us which are ſaved, it is the Power of God. For it is written, I will deſtroy the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the wiſe, and will bring to nothing the underſtanding of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Where is the wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the diſputer of this world? hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world? For after that, in the wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching, to ſave them that beleeve. For the Jews require a ſign, and the Greeks ſeek after wiſdom. But we preach Chriſt crucified, unto the Jews a ſtumbling block, and unto the Greeks fooliſhneſs: But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:166934:11"/>
the Power of God, and the Wiſdom of God. Becauſe the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer then men: and the weakneſs of God is ſtronger then men. For ye ſee your calling brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mighty, not many noble are called. But God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe: and God hath choſen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty: And baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed hath God choſen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are, That no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence. But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Redemption: That
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:166934:11"/>
according as it is writen, He that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth let him glory in the Lord.</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>And J, brethren, when J came to you, came not with excellency of ſpeech, or of wiſdom, declaring unto you the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God. For J determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and him crucified. And J was with you in weakneſs, and in fear, and in much trembling. And my ſpeech, and my preaching was not with entiſing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power: That your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the Power of God. Howbeit we ſpeak wiſdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wiſdom of this world, nor of the Princes of this world, that come
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:166934:12"/>
to nought: But we ſpeak the Wiſdom of God in a myſtery: even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the world, unto our glory. Which none of the Princes of this World knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his ſpirit: for the ſpirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the things of a man, ſave the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man which is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man but the ſpirit of God.</hi> And read like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10.11. <hi>For this is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:166934:12"/>
that J will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord: J will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hea ts, and J will be unto them a God, and they ſhall be unto me a people. And they ſhall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, ſaying, know the Lord: for all ſhall know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> And 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.26, 27. <hi>Theſe things have J written unto you concerning them that ſeduce you. But the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: and ye need not that any man teach you: but, as the ſame anointing teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lye: and even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him.</hi> Alſo 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We have alſo a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:166934:13"/>
more ſure word of Propheſie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day Star ariſe in your hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is apparent we have a light within our ſelves, better then any candles of our own wiſdom, namely, the wiſdom of Chriſt; a day ſtar, that the Apoſtle directs us to; and that the way to know Chriſt, and the only way, is, by the inward unction, the Baptiſm of the Spirit. Now when our ſoul receives a glance or beam of Gods wrath, thereby it reflects on its fall, and ſin is made manifeſt to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, wherby we are overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſorrow &amp; grief for a time. For where the entire will of ſin is pierced quite through by repentance, and ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:166934:13"/>
opened and ſearcht, there the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl of Love, penetrateth and healeth all the wounds. Thus the Father Baptizeth, the Son Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the Holy Ghoſt Ordereth All, and directeth us to a new Life. This is the manner wherewith the Holy Trinity Baptizeth in its Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations in Man. Now beyond and beſides this is the Trinity it ſelf, God in one only Good. Where we do not affirm that the Father is wrath the Son this or that thing, but the good being in himſelf: But according to the great Myſtery before named in the fourth Paragraph, wherein he doth manifeſt himſelf. For the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man was made to this end and purpoſe only, namely, that God might be known. Thus you may
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:166934:14"/>
underſtand the Baptiſm of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the inward ſpring and fountain of the ſoul, where the Father Baptizeth with fire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are inwardly made ſenſible of the bitter ſufferings of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>For as the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt.</hi> So that we are brought into bondage and ſlavery &amp; afflicted by wrath, that we may be freed by Love, who pacifieth the ſame, whereby we are likewiſe made apprehenſive of obtaining a victory. Thus the ſoul is wounded by the wrath of God, healed by the Love of God, and by the Holy Ghoſt the comforter, baptized with a new life and underſtanding. I ſpeak not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the outward Baptiſm of water,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:166934:14"/>
cauſe Chriſt himſelf uſed the ſame, provided it be uſed as a Figure onely of this. Now when we are thus bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, we are often in communion with God, eating his body and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his blood: and it were well if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this accompt we met at the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, breaking bread day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.33. <hi>For the bread of God is he which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</hi> And Verſ. 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58. <hi>J am that bread of life. Your Fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſs, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that a man may eat thereof, and not dye. J am the living bread, which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he ſhal live for ever:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:166934:15"/>
and the bread that J will give, is my fleſh, which J will give for the life of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily, verily, J ſay unto you, Except ye eate the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Who ſo eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood hath eternal life, and J will raiſe him up at the laſt day. For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and J in him. As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father: ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me. This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat Manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread ſhall live for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:166934:15"/>
ever.</hi> And verſ. 63, 64, 65. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing: the words that I ſpeak unto you they are Spirit, and they are life. But there are ſome of you that beleeve not. For Jeſus knew from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who they were that beleeved not, and who ſhould betray him. And he ſaid, Therefore ſaid I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</hi> But this ſpiritual Reſurrection, this ſpiritual Baptiſm and Supper of the Lord, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 5.21, 25. <hi>Verily, verily J ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, He that heareth my words, and beleeveth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death unto life.

unvaluable price, as the final Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, the heavenly Bread and Wine, whereof that of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was a figure, and the everlaſting Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of all heavenly Treaſures, of which you may ſee more at large, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Without father, without mother, without deſcent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God, abideth a Prieſt continually:</hi> and then enables us to offer unto God the ſacrifices of everlaſting praiſes; not of ſins, but remiſſion of ſins.
